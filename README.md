# see-something-new

### A website which shows you an image you statistically have never seen before and will never see again.

Javascript algorithm creates 160,000 1x1px divs with randomly set hex code color (16,777,216 color possibilities per pixel) backgrounds in a 400x400px square. It really eats at your CPU so be warned if you're running this on a potato.

## Philosophy

When you refresh the image, you have a possibility, regardless of how slim, of seeing a picture of anything in existence (even a selfie of yourself!). You are looking at something which has statistically never been viewed by any human in all of history or will ever see throughout the life of the universe. There is a 2.68435456e+12 chance which is 1 in 2,684,354,560,000 of any one image being shown to you. Double that number for the chance that the same image will occur again. <br> A thought may cross your mind: "This is pointless. I'm looking at non-sense." And to that I ask you to ask yourself... what you were expecting to see? Do you count beauty and significance as something which resembles other things you have seen? Do you rely on past experience and pure optical sensory parsing as a way to determine what is incredible? Does a thing need to be repeatable or have a categorical title in order to strike you as appealing? As you peer into the generative cacophany, consider that you have seen what no other has seen before. And if you find yourself looking at a perfect photo of the Milky Way galaxy, remember that probability is a strange magic.
